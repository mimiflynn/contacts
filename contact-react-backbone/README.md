# Contacts App made with React and Backbone

## POC

Goal is to exhibit that:
- Backbone for models and collections
- React for views and controllers

## Requirements

```
gem install compass
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Development

Run `npm install` from this directory and then `grunt` to fire up a server. This server is separate from the main project's server. You will need to run the root project's server for access to the data backend, so be sure to `cd ..` from this directory and run `node server.js`.
